### Hello There!

I'm a brazilian Electrical Engineer passionate about knowledge dissemination. One can find my bachelor of science thesis [here](https://github.com/tenorio-vivianesgm/bsc-thesis).
During undergrad years, I took part in many research projects:
- Thermoresistive Sensors (_2012 - present_)
- Synchronous A/D Converters (_2013 - 2014_)
- Non-invasive System of Deep and Focused Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (_2013 - 2014_)
- Phase-lag synchronization analysis in complex systems & Neuroscience (_2015 - present_)

These projects resulted in papers you can find [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ET9EBQYAAAAJ). Although I'm not really the Geek stereotype, I really love to learn and I'm curious about pretty much anything I don't understand.

In the undergrad years, I was an exchange student at Politecnico di Milano (2014/2015). There I learned italian (half od the courses were taught in italian back then), I discovered a new culture and learned a lot about biomedical engineering. I studied nervous systems diseases, the bioengineering behind the visual and hearing systems and a little of neuroengineeering. It was a challenge in many ways, but it made me grow and discover how much electrical engineering has to give to health sciences.


For this reason, I am persuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering focusing on Information Measurements. I also plan to pursue a phd degree but I'm not sure about the challenge I'll chose next.

If you want to get in touch, just send me an [email](mailto:tenorio.vivianesgm@gmail.com). I check it more often then I probably should. :)
