### Hello There!

I'm a brazilian Electrical Engineer passionate about knowledge dissemination. One can find my bachelor of science thesis [here](https://github.com/tenorio-vivianesgm/bsc-thesis).
During undergrad years, I took part in many research projects:
- Thermoresistive Sensors (_2012 - present_)
- Synchronous A/D Converters (_2013 - 2014_)
- Non-invasive System of Deep and Focused Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (_2013 - 2014_)
- Phase-lag synchronization analysis in complex systems & Neuroscience (_2015 - present_)
